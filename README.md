This repository contains a parser and an editor for [Rtype][Rtype] type definitions.
The parser is generated by [ANTLR4][ANTLR4] based on the grammar **Rtype.g4**.
The editor is based on [ACE editor][ACE editor],
but uses the ANTLR4 generated lexer for syntax highlighting (see [antlr4-ace-ext][antlr4-ace-ext], **my-mode.js** and **rtype-token-type-mapping.js**)
and the ANTLR4 generated parser to provide error annotations (see **my-worker.js**).
